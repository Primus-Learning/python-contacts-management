# Python - Contacts registry

We need to create a python program for contacts management.
The users should be able to manage their contacts and upload it online.

## Functionnalities

- Create a new contact
- List contacts
- Get all informations about a single contact
- Upload the contacts registry to the cloud

## Details

We should build a main menu that allows the user to make some actions according to what we have as functionnality.

The contacts should be saved into a file located inside the `data` directory.

Saving the contacts in the cloud just means uploading the contacts file to an AWS S3 bucket.

The format to use while saving the contacts should be JSON.
